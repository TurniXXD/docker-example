# Run MongoDB database in docker container
1. Pull latest mongo image from docker hub
'docker pull mongo:latest'

2. Create directory for your MongoDB database

3. Run mongo image in detach mode, 
map port to your desired port, 
map volumes (database collections will be saved into volumes in your created directory, thus they will survive database restart and even deleting and creating a new mongo image as long as they are in your created directory),
assign name to container,
specify image name and tags:
'docker run -d -p 2717:27017 -v /docker/mongodb:/data/db --name mongodb-test mongo:latest'

4. execute terminal with interactive mode in mongo container:
'docker exec -it mongodb-test bash'

5. Run mongo in mongo container and enjoy your MongoDB database:
`mongo`
